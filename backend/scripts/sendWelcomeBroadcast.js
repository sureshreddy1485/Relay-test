We are thrilled to officially welcome you to Relay — the lightning-fast, ultra-secure messaging platform. We've packed this release with incredible features. Here is your official patch note guide to everything you can do:

💬 **Instant Messaging & Media**
Chat with your friends effortlessly. Send texts, voice notes, photos, and files. Made a typo? You have 15 minutes to edit your messages.

👻 **Disappearing Messages**
Privacy is our priority. Tap the '+' button to send 'View Once' media, or enable disappearing messages in any chat's settings to have all messages self-destruct automatically.

🤖 **Meet Mica & Mars (AI Bots)**
Relay features two native AI companions! Mica is helpful and friendly. Mars is sarcastic and witty. In any group chat, admins can instantly switch the active bot by typing \`!swap\`. Ask them anything!

🎮 **Play Games & Compete**
Bored? Just type \`!scramble\` in any group chat with Mica or Mars. The bot will jumble a word, and everyone can race to solve it. Your scores are tracked on the Global Leaderboard!

👥 **Communities & Group Tags**
Build your community by creating Group Chats. Every group has a unique 'Group Tag' that others can search to join instantly!

🔔 **Native Stacked Notifications**
Even if your app is completely closed, our native background engine ensures you never miss a message. You can even reply and mark messages as read directly from your lock screen.

🔒 **Privacy Control**
Go to Settings to fine-tune your visibility. Hide your Last Seen, Profile Picture, or Read Receipts whenever you want.

We hope you love using Relay as much as we loved building it. Enjoy chatting!`;
